    An AND-equation is an equation that looks like this:
    X[0] AND X[1] AND ... AND X[N-1] = Y
    Here X[i] and Y are non-negative integers and the bitwise AND operation is defined in the Notes.
    In C++, C#, and Java the operator AND is denoted "&". So for example (P & Q & R) is the bitwise AND of numbers P, Q, and R.
    In VB the same operator is denoted "And".
    You are given a A that contains exactly N+1 elements. Your task is to construct an AND-equation using each element of A exactly once.
    (That is, N of them will be on the left hand side of the AND-equation and the remaining one will be on the right hand side.)
    If this is possible, return the value of Y in this AND-equation. If no AND-equation can be constructed, return -1.
    (It can be shown that for each A there is at most one possible value Y, so the return value is always defined correctly.)
